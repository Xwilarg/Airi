# Airi
Airi is a Stella bot for Soul Worker\
Airi works entirely by looking at the minimap of the game

The bot is able to follow the player in a level and throw attack spells\
If the bot stop moving that probably mean it can't find you, if it happens just try to come closer to it. Same if it stay stuck in walls

## Compile the project
Install [premake5] and type the following command
```
premake5 vs2019
```

## What is the goal of this project
I began to play with a friend and we fastly reached level 54, then we realised that we needed around 130 000 000 experience point to go to the next level.<br/>
But in Soul Worker you earn more exp when you play with other people.<br/>
We though that it could be great to have a bot that could play with us, just following us and throwing some heal spell sometimes.

## What can it do ?
For now, the bot is able to follow you in a level and to throw attack spells.<br/>
If the bot stop moving that probably mean it can't find you, if it happens just try to come closer to it. Same if it stay stuck in walls.
