# KotodamaAiri
Kotodama Airi is a Stella bot for Soul Worker.

## What is the goal of this project
I began to play with a friend and we fastly reached level 54, then we realised that we needed around 130 000 000 experience point to go to the next level.<br/>
But in Soul Worker you earn more exp when you play with other people.<br/>
We though that it could be great to have a bot that could play with us, just following us and throwing some heal spell sometimes.

## What can it do ?
For now, the bot is able to follow you in a level and to throw attack spells.<br/>
If the bot stop moving that probably mean it can't find you, if it happens just try to come closer to it. Same if it stay stuck in walls.

## How does it work ?
At first, you need to know that the bot need his own computer and his own game, that means you can't play on the same computer as it.<br/>
Your first step is to clone the project and to open it with Visual Studio 2019.<br/>
Once it's done, just launch it and follow the instruction on screen.<br/>
The bot rely entirely on the mini map so don't move the game window once the bot is launched.
